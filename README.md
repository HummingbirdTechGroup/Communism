## Usage

If you want to extract any object property, use one of the following constructions:

```php
$value = From($object)->property;
// or
$value = From($object)->extract('property');
```

If you want to inject any object property, use one of the following constructions:

```php
To($object)->property = $value;
// or
To($object)->inject('property', $value);
```

If you want to replace any object property, use one of the following constructions:

```php
// The `replace` method is avilable for both `From` and `To`
From($object)->property(function ($value) {
    // `$value` will contain the current value for that property
    
    // Whatever is returned will be the new value of the property
    return $newValue;
});
// or
From($object)->replace('property', function ($value) {
    // `$value` will contain the current value for that property
    
    // Whatever is returned will be the new value of the property
    return $newValue;
});
```

Both functions `From` and `To` instantiate a `carlosV2\Communism\Communist` object which
allows the extraction and injection of properties.
